To resolve these issues, we propose a new definition of hypergraph that unifies the concepts of undirected, directed and nested hypergraphs, and that is uniform in using hyperedge as a single construct for representing high-order correlations among things, i.e., nodes and hyperedges. Specifically, we define a hyperedge to be a simple hyperedge, a nesting hyperedge, or a directed hyperedge. With this new definition, a hypergraph is nested if it has nesting hyperedge(s), and is directed if it has directed hyperedge(s). Otherwise, a hypergraph is a simple hypergraph. The uniformity and power of this new definition, with visualization, should facilitate the use of hypergraph for representing (hierarchical) high-order correlations in general and chemical systems in particular. Graph has been widely used as a mathematical structure for machine learning on molecular structures and 3D molecular geometries. However, graph has a major limitation: it can represent only pairwise correlations between nodes. Hypergraph extends graph with high-order correlations among nodes. This extension is significant or essential for machine learning on chemical systems. For molecules, this is significant as it allows the direct, explicit representation of multicenter bonds and molecular substructures. For chemical reactions, this is essential since most chemical reactions involve multiple participants.

Specifically, to address the data heterogeneity across domains, we introduce an approach called hypergraph signal decoupling (HSD) to decouple the user features into domain-exclusive and domain-shared features. The approach employs high-pass and low-pass hypergraph filters to decouple domain-exclusive and domain-shared user representations, which are trained by the local-global bi-directional transfer algorithm. In addition, a hypergraph contrastive learning (HCL) module is devised to enhance the learning of domain-shared user relationship information by perturbing the user hypergraph.

To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control.

The higher-order nature of these interactions, involving many units at once, and their temporal dynamics constitute crucial properties that shape the behaviour of the system itself. An adequate description of these systems is offered by temporal hypergraphs, that integrate these features within the same framework. However, tools for their temporal and topological characterization are still scarce. Here we develop a series of methods specifically designed to analyse the structural properties of temporal hypergraphs at multiple scales. Leveraging the hyper-core decomposition of hypergraphs, we follow the evolution of the hyper-cores through time, characterizing the hypergraph structure and its temporal dynamics at different topological scales, and quantifying the multi-scale structural stability of the system. We also define two static hypercoreness centrality measures that provide an overall description of the nodes aggregated structural behaviour. We apply the characterization methods to several data sets, establishing connections between structural properties and specific activities within the systems. Finally, we show how the proposed method can be used as a model-validation tool for synthetic temporal hypergraphs, distinguishing the higher-order structures and dynamics generated by different models from the empirical ones, and thus identifying the essential model mechanisms to reproduce the empirical hypergraph structure and evolution.

In addition to studying their emergent behavior, a main focus of the mathematical community has been concentrated on deriving their large-population limit. In particular, the mean-field limit consists of describing the limit system by its population density in the product space of positions and labels. The strategy to derive such limits is often based on a careful combination of methods ranging from analysis of PDEs and stochastic analysis, to kinetic equations and graph theory. In this article, we focus on a generalization of multi-agent systems that includes higher-order interactions, which has largely captured the attention of the applied community in the last years. In such models, interactions between individuals are no longer assumed to be binary (i.e. between a pair of particles). Instead, individuals are allowed to interact by groups so that a full group jointly generates a non-linear force on any given individual. The underlying graph of connections is then replaced by a hypergraph, which we assume to be dense, but possibly non uniform and of unbounded rank. For the first time in the literature, we show that when the interaction kernels are regular enough, then the mean-field limit is determined by a limiting Vlasov-type equation, where the hypergraph limit is encoded by a so-called UR-hypergraphon (unbounded-rank hypergraphon), and where the resulting mean-field force admits infinitely-many orders of interactions.", "source": "Arxiv", "date": "2024-06-07", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Hypergraph-Mlp: Learning on Hypergraphs Without Message Passing", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-01-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "The Maximal Running Time of Hypergraph Bootstrap Percolation", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-01-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Multilevel polynomial partitioning and semialgebraic hypergraphs: regularity, Tur\\'an, and Zarankiewicz results", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": ["Combinatorics"], "abstract": "We prove three main results about semialgebraic hypergraphs. First, we prove an optimal and oblivious regularity lemma. Fox, Pach, and Suk proved that the class of $k$-uniform semialgebraic hypergraphs satisfies a very strong regularity lemma where the vertex set can be partitioned into $\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)$ parts so that all but an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of $k$-tuples of parts are homogeneous (either complete or empty). Our result improves the number of parts in the partition to $O_{d,k}((D/\\varepsilon)^{d})$ where $d$ is the dimension of the ambient space and $D$ is a measure of the complexity of the hypergraph; additionally, the partition is oblivious to the edge set of the hypergraph. We give examples that show that the dependence on both $\\varepsilon$ and $D$ is optimal. From this regularity lemma we deduce the best-known Tur\\'an-type result for semialgebraic hypergraphs. Third, we prove a Zarankiewicz-type result for semialgebraic hypergraphs. Previously Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl showed that a $K_{u,u}$-free semialgebraic graph on $N$ vertices has at most $O_{d,D,u}(N^{2d/(d+1)+o(1)})$ edges and Do extended this result to $K_{u,\\ldots,u}^{(k)}$-free semialgebraic hypergraphs. We improve upon both of these results by removing the $o(1)$ in the exponent and making the dependence on $D$ and $u$ explicit and polynomial. All three of these results follow from a novel ``multilevel polynomial partitioning scheme'' that efficiently partitions a point set $P\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$ via low-complexity semialgebraic pieces. We prove this result using the polynomial method over varieties as developed by Walsh which extends the real polynomial partitioning technique of Guth and Katz.

While it is known that $forb(n,H)=2^{(1+o(1))ex(n,H)}$ for $k$-uniform hypergraphs that are not $k$-partite, estimates for hypergraphs that are $k$-partite (or degenerate) are not nearly as tight. In a recent breakthrough, Ferber, McKinley, and Samotij proved that for many degenerate hypergraphs $H$, $forb(n, H) = 2^{O(ex(n,H))}$. However, there are few known instances of degenerate hypergraphs $H$ for which $forb(n,H)=2^{(1+o(1))ex(n,H)}$ holds.

Rather than operating on the entire event in a single pass, we train HGPflow on smaller partitions to avoid potentially learning long-range correlations related to the physics process. We demonstrate that this approach is feasible and that on most metrics, HGPflow outperforms both traditional particle flow algorithms and a machine learning-based benchmark model.", "source": "Arxiv", "date": "2024-10-30", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Self-Supervised Masked Hypergraph Autoencoders for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-01-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "A Mixed Hypergraph Convolutional Network for Session-Based Recommendation", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-01-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "PN-HGNN: Precipitation Nowcasting Network Via Hypergraph Neural Networks", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-01-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "HyperMatch: long-form text matching via hypergraph convolutional networks", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-11-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "DHMAE: A Disentangled Hypergraph Masked Autoencoder for Group Recommendation", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-01-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Tri-directional Hypergraph Contrastive Learning for Session-based Recommendation", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-01-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Putting Sense into Incomplete Heterogeneous Data with Hypergraph Clustering Analysis", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-01-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Intent Enhanced Self-supervised Hypergraph Learning for Session-Based Recommendation", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-01-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Research on migraine classification model based on hypergraph neural network", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-11-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Estimating package arrival time via heterogeneous hypergraph neural network", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-03-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Divide-Aggregate Heterogeneous Hypergraph for large-scale user intention detection", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-01-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Parallel Set Cover and Hypergraph Matching via Uniform Random Sampling", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-01-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Hypergraph Representation Learning for Remote Sensing Image Change Detection", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-09-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "LightHGNN: Distilling Hypergraph Neural Networks into MLPs for 100x Faster Inference", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-01-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Hypergraph Dualization with sfFPT-delay Parameterized by the Degeneracy and Dimension", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-01-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Hypergraph Information Bottleneck for Brain Network Classification", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": [], "abstract": "", "source": "DBLP", "date": "2024-10-01", "funding_agencies": []}}, {"edge": "Focal-free uniform hypergraphs and codes", "weight": 1, "attrs": {"tags": ["Combinatorics", "Information Theory", "Information Theory"], "abstract": "Motivated by the study of a variant of sunflowers, Alon and Holzman recently introduced focal-free hypergraphs.

In this work, we introduce a novel and general latent embedding approach that addresses these challenges through the integration of latent embeddings, vertex degree heterogeneity parameters, and an order-adjusting parameter. Theoretically, we investigate the identifiability conditions for the latent embeddings and associated parameters, and we establish the convergence rates of their estimators along with asymptotic distributions. Computationally, we employ a projected gradient ascent algorithm for parameter estimation. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and validate the theoretical findings.

Our algorithms are implicit, avoiding formation of the order $r$ adjacency tensor. Here, we demonstrate the flexibility and utility of our approach in practice by developing tensor-based hypergraph centrality and clustering algorithms.

In accordance with the standard theory for hypergraphs, this model is constructed from a bipartite graph. In our stochastic model, both vertex sets of this bipartite graph form marked Poisson point processes and the connection radius is inversely proportional to a product of suitable powers of the marks. Hence, our model is a common generalization of weighted random connection models and AB random geometric graphs. For this hypergraph model, we investigate the limit theory of a variety of graph-theoretic and topological characteristics such as higher-order degree distribution, Betti numbers of the associated Dowker complex as well as simplex counts. In particular, for the latter quantity we identify regimes of convergence to normal and to stable distribution depending on the heavy-tailedness of the weight distribution.

Directed hypergraphs distinguish between source and target sets within each hyperedge, and allow to account for the directional flow of information between nodes. Here, we provide a framework to characterize the structural organization of directed higher-order networks at their microscale. First, we extract the fingerprint of a directed hypergraph, capturing the frequency of hyperedges with a certain source and target sizes, and use this information to compute differences in higher-order connectivity patterns among real-world systems. Then, we formulate reciprocity in hypergraphs, including exact, strong, and weak definitions, to measure to which extent hyperedges are reciprocated. Finally, we extend motif analysis to identify recurring interaction patterns and extract the building blocks of directed hypergraphs.

In this paper, we propose a framework for link prediction with relational hypergraphs, unlocking applications of graph neural networks to fully relational structures. Theoretically, we conduct a thorough analysis of the expressive power of the resulting model architectures via corresponding relational Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms and also via logical expressiveness.

Among the various methods for solving the IM problem, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been shown to be particularly effective. While the literature on the topic is particularly ample, only a few attempts have been made at solving the IM problem over higher-order networks, namely extensions of standard graphs that can capture interactions that involve more than two nodes. Hypergraphs are a valuable tool for modeling complex interaction networks in various domains; however, they require rethinking of several graph-based problems, including IM.

Traditional models often struggle to capture the intricate and dynamic relationships between news events and market reactions, limiting their ability to provide actionable insights. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through the development of a Geometric Hypergraph Attention Network (GHAN) to analyze the impact of financial news on market behaviours. Geometric hypergraphs extend traditional graph structures by allowing edges to connect multiple nodes, effectively modelling high-order relationships and interactions among financial entities and news events. This unique capability enables the capture of complex dependencies, such as the simultaneous impact of a single news event on multiple stocks or sectors, which traditional models frequently overlook. By incorporating attention mechanisms within hypergraphs, GHAN enhances the model's ability to focus on the most relevant information, ensuring more accurate predictions and better interpretability. Additionally, we employ BERT-based embeddings to capture the semantic richness of financial news texts, providing a nuanced understanding of the content. Using a comprehensive financial news dataset, our GHAN model addresses key challenges in financial news impact analysis, including the complexity of high-order interactions, the necessity for model interpretability, and the dynamic nature of financial markets. Integrating attention mechanisms and SHAP values within GHAN ensures transparency, highlighting the most influential factors driving market predictions.

Players in the real world, however, optimize their policies based not only on their histories but also on the histories of their co-players, and the game is played in a group manner.

Interestingly, we identify regular and anti-coordinated chessboard structures in the spatial pattern that positively contribute to the first cooperation transition but adversely affect the second. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical treatment for the first transition with an approximated first transition point and reveal that players with a long-sighted perspective and low exploration rate are more likely to reciprocate kindness with each other, thus facilitating the emergence of cooperation.
